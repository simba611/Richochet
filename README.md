## Brick Breaker Game
### The game starts with initial position of the ball randomly on the paddle. You can move the paddle left or right using 'a' and 'd' characters respectively. 
### Press 'w' to launch the ball. Once the ball launches it will collide with the walls, bricks and paddle. If it misses the paddle you lose a life. There are a total of 3 lives. 
### The bricks have different strength levels with -
Red = Strength 3, Yellow = Strength 2, Green = Strength 1
Grey = Unbreakable 
Magenta = Explosive 

### If an explosive brick is hit, it will break all bricks around it including unbreakable bricks and will cause a chain reaction with the rest of the explosive bricks

### Upon breaking a brick a powerup might drop from the following - 
F = Fast Ball - Increases the speed of the ball for duration of he powerup. It stacks if you pick up more than one.
L = Large paddle - Increases the length of the paddle for the duration of the powerup. It stacks if you pick up more than one.
S = Small paddle - Decreases the length of the paddle for the duration of the powerup. It stacks but doesn;t decrease below certain limit.
P = Paddle Grab - Allows the paddle to grab the ball and move it before releasing it with 'w' again for the duration of the powerup.
T = Through Ball - The ball destroys all blocks in its path for the duration of the powerup

### All powerups have duration 20 seconds and will reset on loss of life.
### A score of 10 is earned everytime a brick other than unbreakable brick is destroyed
